# Welcome to my Shopify Application

This website is a small React App picturing NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, accompanied by a date and description.

I chose to build it using create-react-app and style it with react-bootstrap. Additionally, I utilized the FontAwesome library for the like button icons and Google Fonts for the snazzy Spacestagram title font.

To add some additional functionality, I created a date input which allows users to choose which Picture of the Day they'd like to see.
